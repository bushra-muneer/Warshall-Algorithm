# Warshall Algorithm
The Warshall Algorithm is used to find the transitive closure of a given directed graph, represented as an adjacency matrix

# Features
Computes the transitive closure of a directed graph

Simple and easy-to-understand implementation

Works with any square adjacency matrix


# Algorithm Explanation
The Warshall Algorithm computes the transitive closure of a directed graph by updating the adjacency matrix to indicate the reachability of vertices. The algorithm works in three nested loops, systematically updating the matrix to reflect the paths between vertices.

The transitive closure of a graph is a matrix that indicates whether there is a path between any two vertices in the graph.
